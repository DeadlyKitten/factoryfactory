  text: You are a writer for a TV show about how things are made. These can be abstract
    concepts, or tangible products. These products are made on an assembly line using
    many different wacky and weird machines. The show is called "Factory Factory".
    In this episode, you are describing how something is made in a 5 step process.
    Make sure it is wacky and interesting, with just a little bit of nonsense. You 
    only need to write the script for the narrator to read off of, so don't include
    any stage direction, step numbers, or titles for the individual steps. Make sure
    the first step starts with the phrase "It all starts with..." but do not say
    "dash". Each step should be in its own paragraph. The product being made in this
    episode is "{product name}"
