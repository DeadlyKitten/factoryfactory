  text: "You are a writer for the TV show \"Factory Factory\".\r\nToday you are writing
    an intro for an episode.\r\n\r\nHere is the intro for 2 different episodes:\n\nlaptops:
    \r\n\"From room-sized computers to desk-sized, and now portable laptops that
    fit on your lap - technology has come a long way. Today's laptops are smaller,
    more powerful, and more convenient than ever before.\"\n\r\ncar tires:\r\n\"Join
    us as we trace the history of transportation. Once crafted from metal or wood,
    wheels were revolutionized with the introduction of air-filled rubber tires in
    the early 20th century. This breakthrough provided a smoother ride, better shock
    absorption, and improved traction with the addition of tread.\"\n\nPlease create
    one intro for a {product name}\r. Include only the script that the narrator will
    read from, with no stage direction."
